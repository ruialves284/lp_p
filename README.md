# LP Project 1

School project for Logic for Programming.

The objective was to create a program that solves the thermometer puzzles.
An example can be found [here](http://puzzlepicnic.com/puzzle?2381). (Bear in mind that this program is designed for linear thermometers only)
More info regarding the project and its objectives can be found in the file projeto_lp.pdf but it's in Portuguese.
In the file exemplos.pdf there are some puzzle examples as well as a brief explanation on how to use the public tests, also in Portuguese.

## Getting Started

The variable's and procedure's names are in Portuguese, as well as the comments. It is a first year course, which is why I assume the teacher uses Portuguese as the language of choice.
There are two Prolog code files, the termoProj.pl that contains the puzzle solver and the puzzle_examples.pl, which is already loaded in the solver. These files should be used using a Prolog environment such as [SWI-Prolog](http://www.swi-prolog.org/).

## Running the tests

The folder publicTests includes the public tests, each with an input and expected output file.

Having the examples already loaded in the program, it's just a matter of comparing the output for each input with the expected output. For the project we had an online platform, reason why I didn't develop code to run the tests automatically.
